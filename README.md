# Sentiment-Analysis-Censorship
Proof of concept: Surface electromyography in conjunction with sentiment analysis could externally manifest the act of controlling ones 'tongue'.

Subvocalization: Movement of phonatory muscles during mental rehearsal of speech.

The knowledge that impulses are a precursor to movement led to the possibility to measure electrical impulses to predict what words would be spoken.

Communicative intent is expressed as distinct sounds, determined by the movement of phonatory muscles. 
The movement (and corresponding impulses) of phonatory muscles can be measured via surface electromyography with a high degree of accuracy. 
Sentiment analysis can be used to filter communicative intent in accordance with a pre-established set of values. Models can be increasingly complex.
